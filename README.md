# CupcakeCorner 
Project 10 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. This app introduces network requests. The user can create a cupcake order, input their delivery address and send off their order.
The website used just sends back the data it received so no real orders are made. 
# Features
- Introcuction to URLSession and making it work with SwiftUI.
- Loading images from a remote server.
- Validating forms with the disabled() modifier.
- Codable conformance to observable classes.
